<h1>Change throughout the 1970s</h1>

  <h2> Early 70s </h2> 
 <p> For women, the Hippie look of the 1960s carried over to the early ’70s. Popular styles included bell bottom pants, frayed jeans, midi skirts, maxi dresses, Tie dye, peasant blouses, and ponchos. Some accessories that will help pull together your early ’70s Hippie outfits are chokers, headbands, scarves, and jewelry made of wood, stones, feathers, and beads. For men, fashion was largely influenced by bright colors and textures. Satin shirts, sometimes with ruffles or lace, were often pared with hip-hugging bell bottoms. Bright colored three piece and double breasted suits in corduroy, paisley, wool, and crushed velvet were popular for special and even every day occasions. More casual looks for men included bell bottom jeans, Tie dye, flannel shirts, pleated pants, and sweaters with oxford shoes, platforms, flips flops, or boots.</p>

  <h2> Mid 70s </h2> 
 <p> By the mid-1970s, the Hippie look fell out of fashion for both men and women, making way for a more casual everyday style. Fitted t-shirts rose in popularity, with elaborate designs, slogans, and sports logos.In the middle of the decade, women began to enter the workforce at a higher rate, which led to more tailored business styles. If you’re putting together this type of look, think tailored blazer, midi skirt, and a fitted blouse with high heels.Men’s suits took on a slightly more European flair, with slimmer cuts, smaller waists, and a straighter leg in the pants. While suits were still popular for all occasions, there was a bigger push for more informal styles. To pull off this look, think flannel or western shirts, sweaters, sweatshirts, jeans, khaki chinos, leather jackets, and oxford shoes. </p>

  <h2> The late 70s </h2> 
 <p>Disco took over fashion for everyone in the mid-late ’70s. Disco styles for women included jersey wrap dresses, tube tops, sequined shirts, spandex shorts, and high slit skirts with boots or chunky heels. Aside from Disco styles, women’s fashion in the late ’70s became more relaxed. Clothes became baggier and more revealing and often resulted in an inverted triangle silhouette. To put together wardrobe for this style, look for cowl-neck shirts, sundresses over tight t-shirts, pantsuits, strapless tops, embroidered vests and jeans, skirts, or Daisy Dukes. The color pallet took a turn to more earthy tones in browns, tan, grays, and light blues. For men, the popular Disco alternative was sportswear. This look included tracksuits, jumpsuits, cardigans, sweaters, puffer vests, and low top sneakers. It was common for t-shirts to be untucked and for collars to be popped.</p>
